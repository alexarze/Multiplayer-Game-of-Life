I. Description

Usage :

1. **~$ javac /path/to/gameoflife.java**
2. **~$ java gameoflife**


The Game of LIfe, also known simply as Life, is a two-dimensional
cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton
Conway in 1970. The idea is that every cell in a square grid has one
of two states, dead or alive. A cell can become alive if it has three neighbors, but dies if it has more than three or less than two. The
result is a pattern of cells which mimicks how simple life forms react
to isolation and overpopulation.

This program is an impimentation of Coway's game that allows you
to draw upon years of research by downloading interesting patterns
from [bitstorm](http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/lexicon/) and using
these patterns in your game. Also, you can save any grid you like and
us it later on in the same manner.

The world of Life has boundless shapes and patterns, each of which
has its own unique evolution, behavior, and interaction with the shapes
around it. Go ahead and start up the program and give it a try.

Life awaits.

- In the file menu, there are several options:
